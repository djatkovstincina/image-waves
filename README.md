# Wave Motion Effect on an Image with Three.js

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a wave motion effect on an image using Three.js. The project focuses on crafting a dynamic 3D plane that simulates wave-like distortions through simplex noise, vertex and fragment shaders, and texture manipulation. By combining creative displacement techniques and color channel effects, it achieves a visually striking, organic motion.

Tech stack:

- Three.js: For rendering the 3D scene and mesh (PlaneGeometry, ShaderMaterial).
- GLSL Shaders: To implement vertex and fragment shaders for wave motion and texture displacement.
- Simplex Noise: Used for generating smooth, random distortions to simulate natural wave behavior.
- Texture Mapping: Adds visual complexity by integrating and manipulating an image texture.
